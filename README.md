# Student Management Database – Task 4

This project is part of my internship at Main Crafts Technology.  
In Task 4, I created **analytical SQL reports** using JOINs, aggregations, and subqueries on the existing Student Management Database (students, courses, enrollments).

## 📘 Task Overview
This task focuses on generating **business-style analytical insights**, similar to what a data analyst prepares for management.  
The reports are built by combining:
- JOINs  
- GROUP BY  
- Aggregation functions  
- Subqueries  

## 📊 Analytical Reports Generated
Using the existing tables, the following reports were created:

### 1. **Average Grade by Gender**
- Compares the average grade of male and female students across all courses.

### 2. **Pass Rate per Course**
- Pass is defined as grade ≥ 40.  
- Displays each course with its overall pass percentage.

### 3. **Top 3 Students Overall**
- Based on highest average grade across all enrolled courses.  
- Uses ORDER BY and LIMIT with aggregated results.

### 4. **Students in Multiple Courses**
- Lists all students who are enrolled in **more than 1 course**.
